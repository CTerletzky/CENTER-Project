# The CENTER Project

Center first opened on September 30th 1985. 
Merged with the AIDS Resource Center April 1st 1997
In November 1998 they had to cut 7 staff members due to decrease in funding. Though in 1999 wisconsin AIDS programs received a combined 11mil from state and federal sources, that isnâ€™t enough though considering the rising infection rates.
