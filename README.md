Merged with the AIDS Resource Center April 1st 1997
In November 1998 they had to cut 7 staff members due to decrease in funding. Though in 1999 wisconsin AIDS programs received a combined 11mil from state and federal sources, that isnâ€™t enough though considering the rising infection rates.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]
